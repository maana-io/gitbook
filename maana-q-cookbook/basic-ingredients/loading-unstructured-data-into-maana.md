# Loading Unstructured Data into Maana

In addition to having the ability to load structured files, one is also able to load [unstructured files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data) into Maana. The ultimate goal is to be able to link the two sources together \(where feasible\) in order to serve up a wholistic view of all relevant information around a topic or problem.

You can load unstructured data files into Maana, following the same process used for Structured Data:  

* Create or select the Workspace where you want to load the data. 
* Go to the **Workspaces** tab and either:  
  * Create a Workspace or,
  * Open a Shared Workspace/Template.

 
* Select the **Upload File** button
* Select the desired file\(s\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  It is also possible to simply drag and drop files into the **Canvas** area to upload them into the current workspace. The platform currently supports the CSV and PDF text file formats, with additional file types to be supported in the near future. 
{% endhint %}

## Additional Bots and Microservices that Mine Unstructured Data

When unstructured data files are loaded, there are additional bots/microservices that can be used to mine the data.  This Entity Extraction includes:  

* Analysis of Comments;
* Descriptions;
* Whole documents used to identify mentions of:
  * Entities 
  * Values
  * Facts
