# 07: Curate Extracted Entities

\[TBD\]

As a user, I want to be able to view the results of the entity extractor bot aka extracted entities for the following purposes:

* get a high level, summarized view of the results using the appropriate viz
* be able to click on the relevant Kind and see extracted results in the context of the selected Kind
  * workspace 1 - running entity extraction on K: text remark produces instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location
  * within ws 1 or create workspace 2 - running entity extraction on K: text remark\_2 produces additional instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location
  * i want to see instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location filtered based on the source Kind\(s\) selected
* be able to remove or change labels as needed
* be able to look at the instances of a Kind and know which ones are sourced from files/documents vs classifier generated
