# Creating a Domain Model through Command Line Interface \(CLI\)

## About this Tutorial

Here is a step-by-step example of an end-to-end flow of creating a domain model, hydrating it with instances, and querying it, all programmatically, using the standard [graphql-cli ](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)utility and the custom Maana plugin.

* Sample code can be found here: [https://github.com/maana-io/q-tutorials/blob/master/cli/ckg.graphql](https://github.com/maana-io/q-tutorials/blob/master/cli/ckg.graphql)
* It is published as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-cli-maana).
* It is best to make a copy of this repo \(delete the .git folder to detach it from GitHub\). Then you can make all the changes you want, check it into a different repo, etc.

### Installation

```
npm i -g graphql-cli graphql-cli-maana
```

## How to Create a Command Line Interface \(CLI\)

### Setup

The CLI uses a [standard configuration format](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config/blob/master/specification.md), .graphqlconfig. The purpose is to provide configurations for the CLI tool.

The tutorial repo you cloned above includes a sample .graphqlconfig. It might be easier to edit it. You can also create your own by \(deleting it and\) following the instructions below.

The config consists of:

* **Projects**: these are equivalent to Maana "service name" and tell the CLI where to find the schema for the endpoint.
* **Endpoints**: these are the "service endpoint URLs".

For consistency and simplicity, we recommend you use the same name for the **Maana service**, the **project**, and the **endpoint** \(e.g., "ckg", "basic", "projectX"\).

### 1. Create a configuration from scratch:

1. Create a CKG project and GraphQL endpoint, as in:

```
gql init
? Enter project name (Enter to skip): ckg
? Local schema file path: ckg.graphql
? Endpoint URL (Enter to skip): https://<maana host>:8443/graphql
? Name of this endpoint, for e.g. default, dev, prod: (default)
? Subscription URL (Enter to skip):
? Do you want to add other endpoints? No
? What format do you want to save your config in? JSON

About to write to /home/me/maana/training/.graphqlconfig:

{
  "projects": {
    "ckg": {
      "schemaPath": "ckg.graphql",
      "extensions": {
        "endpoints": {
          "default": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

? Is this ok? Yes
```

### 2. Authenticate with Maana

Maana endpoints require a valid \(authenticated\) user in order to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Maana Q v3.1.0 and later

After creating a new `.graphqlconfig` file connecting to a Maana API endpoint:

1. Login to the Maana Knowledge Portal
2. Click on your user icon and select your profile
3. At the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button
4. Go through the login process \(again\)
5. Copy the generated auth token that shows up below the button
6. In the terminal run `gql msignin` and when asked paste the Authentication Token into the prompt
7. Run `gql menv --shell <your shell>` in the current terminal window to run authenticated GraphQL calls.
   * Example: Run `gql menv --shell bash` if you are using bash
   * You will see output similar to:

     ```
     export MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<token here>
     # Run this command to configure your shell
     # eval $(gql menv --shell bash)
     ```

   * Now run `eval $(gql menv --shell bash)` like it asks you at the bottom of the output
8. Run `gql ping` to test out that the authentication works \(you will get an error if it did not\)

{% hint style="info" %}
#### **Additional Notes**

* When you add another project to your `.graphqlconfig` file you can run `gql maddheaders --project <Project Name>`to add the headers to the new project.
* When you want to run the CLI against the Maana API in a different terminal window you will need to run `gql env` again.
* If your authentication token expires you can run `gql mrefreshauth` to refresh the authentication token, when the Maana API is configured to allow the refreshing of authentication tokens.
{% endhint %}

#### Maana Q v3.0.5

After creating a new project connecting to a Maana endpoint, you will need to setup the project to add an authentication header to the requests.

1. Login to the Maana Knowledge Portal
2. Click on your user icon and select your profile
3. At the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button
4. Go through the login process \(again\)
5. Copy the generated auth token that shows up below the button
6. In the terminal add an environment variable for the auth token

```
# *nix based systems
export MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<paste auth token here>
```

```
rem Windows command line
set MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<paste auth token here>
```

```
# Windows power shell
$Env:MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN = "<paste auth token here>"
```

7. Add the authorization header to the Maana endpoint:

```
     "ckg": {
      "schemaPath": "ckg.graphql",
       "extensions": {
         "endpoints": {
-           "default": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"
+           "default": {
+             "url": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql",
+             "headers": {
+               "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN}"
+             }
+           }
         }
       }
     }
```

### 3. Create the Model

1. Let's first define a simple schema to use, e.g., model.gql:

```
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  dob: String
  employer: Employer
}

type Employer {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  ceo: Person
}
```

### 4. Create the Service

Now that you've defined your model, you would like Maana to manage it for you \(i.e., create a graph and all of the boilerplate operations, such as add, updating, and deleting instances, querying them, generating events, etc.\).  
  
1. Execute the **maddsvc** \("add service"\) command, which takes the **service name** and the **GraphQL model** definition \(i.e., your types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions\):

```
gql maddsvc Basic -s basic/model.gql -p ckg
Using endpoint default: {"url":"https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"}
Read file: basic/model.gql size: 136
Sending query:
  mutation addServiceSource($input: AddServiceSourceInput!) {
    addServiceSource(input: $input)
  }
  ...
âœ” Call succeeded:
{"addServiceSource":"1788c00e-3a29-4843-aa56-44ba374cf682"}
```

2. Take note of the generated service id, since you'll add it as a new GraphQL **endpoint** to your CLI configuration.

### 5. Update the Config

Add another project to you graphql config using the following template to build your service url. Make sure that your url ends in `/graphql`.

#### Template:

```
https://<maana host>:8443/service/<service id>/graphql
```

#### Command:

```
gql add-project
? Enter project name for new project: basic
? Local schema file path: basic/schema.graphql
? Endpoint URL (Enter to skip): <service url>
? Name of this endpoint, for e.g. default, dev, prod: (default)
? Subscription URL (Enter to skip):
? Do you want to add other endpoints? No

Adding the following endpoints to your config:  basic
? Is this ok? Yes
```

#### Again, you need to add the authorization header.

* In Maana Q 3.1.0 or later just run the `gql maddheaders` command.
* In Maana Q 3.5.0 will require adding it manually, check [here](https://github.com/maana-io/q-tutorials/tree/master/cli#v3.0.5) for instructions.

### 6. Introspecting the Service

Only a few types were specified for the **domain model**. Maana adds a set of boilerplate types and operations as part of a fully-managed service. The **schema** for this service can be retrieved by:

```
gql get-schema -p basic
```

### 7. Creating Instance Data

1. Create instances from common data formats, such as CSV and JSON that conform to the model. The /basic examples of person and employer instance data are given below.

#### Ex: person.csv

```
"id","name","dob","employer"
"P00","Han Solo","1942-07-13","E00"
"P01","George Lucas","1944-05-14","E00"
```

#### Ex: employer.csv

```
"id","name","ceo"
"E00","Lucasfilm Ltd.","P01"
```

#### Ex: person.json

```
[
  {
    "id": "P00",
    "name": "Han Solo",
    "dob": "1942-07-13",
    "employer": "E00"
  },
  {
    "id": "P01",
    "name": "George Lucas",
    "dob": "1944-05-14",
    "employer": "E00"
  }
]
```

#### Ex: employer.json

```
[
  {
    "id": "E00",
    "name": "Lucasfilm Ltd.",
    "ceo": "P01"
  }
]
```

### 8. Loading Instance Data

The above CSV and JSON data can be loaded by using the 'load' GraphQL CLI command, passing the mutation to call, the data file, field mappings \(if any\). delimeters, etc.

```
gql mload basic/person.json -p basic
gql mload basic/employer.json -p basic
```

### 9. Using Default Queries

The boilerplate for persisted models includes add/update/delete mutations as well as get by id and get batch by ids queries that can be used from GraphiQL, the CLI, or from any GraphQL client. For the above 'basic' example, you'll define the below queries.

This is exactly the same format as you would use in GraphiQL ---- try cut-and-pasting the below into a GraphiQL session against your service.

#### basicOps.gql

```
fragment personDetail on Person {
  name
  dob
  employer {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}

fragment employerDetail on Employer {
  name
  ceo {
    name
  }
}

query person($id: ID!) {
  person(id: $id) {
    ...personDetail
  }
}

query allPersons {
  allPersons {
    ...personDetail
  }
}

query employer($id: ID!) {
  employer(id: $id) {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}

query allEmployers {
  allEmployers {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}
```

These queries can be invoked from the command line, such as:

```
gql query basic/basicOps.gql -p basic -o allEmployers
gql query basic/basicOps.gql -p basic -o person --variables "{\"id\":\"P01\"}"
```
