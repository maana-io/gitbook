# Field Classifier Tutorials

As with most knowledge services, Field Classifier \(FC\) can be included in a solution through the use of [function composition](../../../product-guide/reference-guide/technical-design-and-architecture/function-modeling/), as per the following tutorial:[ FC- Function Composition](field-classifier-function-composition-tutorial.md)

For some use-cases, it may be more convenient to use the included [UI Assistant](../../../product-guide/reference-guide/q-platform-and-microservices/service-types/service-assistants/), as per the following tutorial: [FC & Assistant Tutorial](field-classifier-and-assistant-tutorial.md)
