# Advanced Recipes

This is a collection of tutorial projects and datasets for learning how to use the Maana Q Knowledge Platform.  Here are a few things to review before moving into the tutorials:

## Git Large File Storage \(LFS\)

This repository contains datasets used for tutorials. In order to accommodate the larger file sizes, we use the the [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) commands.

## Maana CLI

All of the tutorials contained here require the use of [Maana CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-cli-maana). For information about changes to the CLI view the [change log](https://github.com/maana-io/Q-cli/blob/master/Changelog.md).

### Installation

When installing maana CLI, make sure the version is the same as your Maana cluster.

### **Requirements:** Node.js 8+ and graphql-cli

```text
# Installing the CLI for the Maaana 3.1.0 release
npm i -g graphql-cli graphql-cli-maana@3.1.0-release
```
