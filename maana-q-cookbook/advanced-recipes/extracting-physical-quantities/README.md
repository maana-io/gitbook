# Extracting Physical Quantities

## About this Tutorial <a id="about-this-tutorial"></a>

This service is used for extracting physical quantities, or measured quantities, from text, and performing dimensionally safe arithmetic, unit conversions and comparisons with them. This service uses a proprietary symbolic computing engine built on top of Stanford CoreNLP's named entity recognition library \([https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/)\).

This sequence of queries extracts pressure measurements from the sample sentence, converts them into head \(in feet of sea water\) and checks to see if the result is greater than an a provided alarm threshold:

```text
query IS_OVERPRESSURE(
  $SOURCE:String!,
  $DENSITY_OF_SEAWATER:PhysicalQuantityInput!,
  $GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION:PhysicalQuantityInput!,
  $ALARM_THRESHOLD:PhysicalQuantityInput!){

  extract(source:$SOURCE){
    entity{
      name
      div(divisor:$DENSITY_OF_SEAWATER){
        div(divisor:$GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION)  {
          isGTE(rhs:$ALARM_THRESHOLD,precision:3)
        }}}}}
```

Queries of this kind facilitate equational reasoning with real world measurements, and can be used to augment the engineering knowledge models. Specifically, this service facilitates equational and graph based reasoning about physical quantities, units of measure, physical dimensions and systems of units.

### Assumptions <a id="assumptions"></a>

1. Entity mentions follow standard notational conventions for products, quotients and exponentials of units of measure.
2. Although aliases are allowed, no unit of measure that is not a product, power or quotient can consist of more than one token. For example: "1 Astronomical unit" would be invalid, but "1 AU" would be acceptable.

The service uses a constructive pattern matching algorithm to parse physical quantities from text. Acronyms, abbreviations and part numbers can easily be misidentified as units of measure. Some data cleansing may be required to get optimal performance.

## Reference Examples <a id="reference-examples"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE on Fragments**: Many of the examples in this document use graphQL fragments to simplify the output specifications. Definitions of the graphQL fragments can be found in the appendix.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE on Variables**: Some examples require execution of a sequence of queries, storing intermediate results in variables to be passed to later stages. For clarity, name the earlier stages of computation with the same name as the variable to which they are bound. 

For example:
{% endhint %}

```text
query FOO{ foo{ ... FooFragment }}
query BAR( $FOO: FooInput ){ ... BarFragment }
```

Means, execute the query FOO, storing the result in the variable $FOO, and then call the query BAR.

### Physical Quantities <a id="physical-quantities"></a>

| Example | How do I get the normalized surface form of a physical quantity? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Info | The physical quantity service automatically normalizes the surface form of physical quantities. Use the name property of the physical quantity type to get the normalized surface form of a physical quantity. The example below demonstrates how to get the normalized surface form of a physical quantity parsed from text. |
| Query | query EXAMPLE1{parse\(source:"ten psi"\){ name }} |
| Response | { "data": { "parse": { "name": "10.0 lb/in²" }}} |

| Example | How do I get the magnitude \(numeric value\) of a physical quantity? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Info | Use the magnitude property of the physical quantity type to get the numeric value of a physical quantity. The example below demonstrates how to get the numeric value of a physical quantity parsed from text. |
| Query | query EXAMPLE2{parse\(source:"ten psi"\){ magnitude }} |
| Response | { "data": { "parse": { "magnitude": 10 }}} |

| Example | How do I get the unit of measure of a physical quantity? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Info | Use the unitOfMeasure property of the physical quantity type to get the unit of measure of a physical quantity. The example below demonstrates how to get the unit of measure of a physical quantity parsed from text. |
| Query | query EXAMPLE3{parse\(source:"ten psi"\){ unitOfMeasure{ name }}} |
| Response | { "data": { "parse": { "unitOfMeasure": { "name": "lb/in²" }}}} |

### Unit Of Measure <a id="unit-of-measure"></a>

| Example | How can I see all the available units of measure? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Info | Since the system can derive an infinite number of units of measure using multiplication, division and exponentiation, It is NOT possible to see ALL available units of measure. Instead, you can use the unitsOfMeasure query to find all the units of measure that have been explicitly defined. The physical quantity service comes out of the box with explicit definitions for the commonly used units of measure for both the MKS and Imperial systems of units. |
| Query | query EXAMPLE4{unitsOfMeasure { name }} |
| Result | { "data": { "unitsOfMeasure": \[{"name": "C"}, {"name": "m"}, { "name": "km"}, { "name": "D" }, .. AND MANY MORE \] }} |
