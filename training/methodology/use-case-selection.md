Step Instructions:

**Step 1:** Familiarize with the spreadsheet below. This includes a methodology for scoring use cases in Maana. 

**Step 2:** Look at the Heat Map tab, Business and Technology Metrics table and understand how these values are derived. For this you would need to look at the Use Cases tab.

**Step 3:** Look also at the Score Card tab and understand how these parameters influence the Business and Technical Scores. 

**Step 4:** Perform a sensitivity analysis changing weigh factors in the Score Card and analyze the impact on Business and Technical Scores. 

**Step 5:** List any limitations of this excel sheet. 

**Step 6:** Now in Maana, draft a problem decomposition architecture to tackle the same functionality as the Excel sheet. What would be a good candidate for a top PQ? What Kinds would be needed? 

**Step 7:** What function s would be required?

**Step 8**: Now look at the workspace below, compare to your approach and to the Excel sheet [https://cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io/workspace/a325799f-7d19-4732-9588-d8d716357ef0](https://cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io/workspace/a325799f-7d19-4732-9588-d8d716357ef0)

**Step 9**: Conclude on advantages and disadvantages on implementing this model in Maana as opposed to Excel.
