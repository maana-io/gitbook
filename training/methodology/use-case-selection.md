### **Introduction**

There is a large variety of methodologies to identify and rank the best opportunity our of a portfolio of prospects.  Across business and technical contexts, decision makers are often confronted with multiple factors which combined might make an opportunity more desirable than another.

Selecting Use Cases to develop in Maana is in fact, a similar type of problem. Interestingly, this problem can also be tackled in Maana, since the emphasis of the technology is that of integration of knowledge in support of decision making. 

This exercise details a methodology which can be used to select Use Cases 'Fit for Maana'. It follows a typical approach common in different organizations to rank prospects in a 'heat-map type of representation' which can be used for communication and decision making. 

The objectives of this exercise are:

* Demonstrate a practical method to rank use cases for Maana, emphasizing key success factors, which can be customized as needed. 
* Articulate problem decomposition methodologies in Maana. 
* Provide a 'bridge' for MS Excel users to build Maana models.

### **Instructions:**

**Step 1:** Open the MS Excel file below. This contains a relatively simple methodology for selecting use cases in Maana based on Technical and Business Metrics.

**Step 2:** Go to the **Heat Map tab**, and familiarize with the dimensions of the matrix. 

Business and Technology Metrics table and understand how these values are derived. For this you would need to look at the Use Cases tab. 

**Step 3:** Look also at the Score Card tab and understand how these parameters influence the Business and Technical Scores. 

**Step 4:** Perform a sensitivity analysis changing weigh factors in the Score Card and analyze the impact on Business and Technical Scores. 

**Step 5:** List any limitations of this excel sheet. 

**Step 6:** Now in Maana, draft a problem decomposition architecture to tackle the same functionality as the Excel sheet. What would be a good candidate for a top PQ? What Kinds would be needed? 

**Step 7:** What function s would be required?

**Step 8**: Now look at the workspace below, compare to your approach and to the Excel sheet [https://cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io/workspace/a325799f-7d19-4732-9588-d8d716357ef0](https://cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io/workspace/a325799f-7d19-4732-9588-d8d716357ef0)

**Step 9**: Conclude on advantages and disadvantages on implementing this model in Maana as opposed to Excel.
