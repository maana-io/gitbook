# Developing a Custom Microservice

## Overview

In our lessons thus far, anytime we've needed to write some custom code, we've used a JavaScript lambda function.  These are fine for what they are intended: short, relatively simple, self-contained \(i.e., minimal external dependencies\) code blocks.  However, there are many cases where full-blown containerized microservices, written in Python, Scala, C\#, Go, Rust, C++, NodeJS, TensorFlow, Spark, etc. are needed to be deployed at scale.

## Introduction

## Lesson Goals

* Using the Maana CLI to create new Q-ready microservices
* Wrap-and-map a service
* Test a service locally
* Deploy a Dockerized service to Kubernetes
* Register a service with Q
