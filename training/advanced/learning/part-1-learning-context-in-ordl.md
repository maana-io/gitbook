# Part 1 - Learning as part of ORDL

### Introduction

Piping is a key component of essentially every facility in oil & gas, Across the value chain, piping is a common asset which represents a significant portion of the Capital Expenditures in any given development project. In Operations, piping is also critical to operating expenses, reliable operations and operating expenses, to mention a few areas. 

Most oil & gas operators maintain a catalog of Piping Classes \(_each class corresponding to one type of Piping, with specifications on operating pressures, temperatures, corrosion allowance, service, etc_.\). Often times, Business Units or Capital Projects in these operators create new classes leading to unnecessary proliferation. Proliferation of Piping Classes is a common problem in the industry, which has connection with sub-optimal capital allocation, increased procurement and warehousing costs and increased operational risks. 

It is also common for Piping Subject Matter Experts to spend significant effort in manually consolidating piping classes across business units. The process can sometimes be subjective as well. This example corresponds to a Knowledge Application which is intended to support the work of Piping SMEs as they perform consolidation.
