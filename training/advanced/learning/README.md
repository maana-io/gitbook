# Learning

### Introduction

The "ORDL" framework is key to the architecture of knowledge applications which not only address a business objective, but which also **improve organically** with the interaction of users. The steps in ORDL are:

1. **Observe** the problem domain.
2. **Reason** over the problem domain to make \(explicable\) recommendations.
3. **Decide** \(help a user\) what action to take.
4. **Learn** from the outcome of the decision in order to make better recommendations.
5. Repeat from step 1

This section provides an overview of Learning through practical examples. 

* [Part 1](part-1-learning-context-in-ordl.md) of this lesson, provides an example of how to incorporate a Learning component on an Oil & Gas Knowledge Model
* [Part 2](part-2-passive-learning.md), provides an example of Passive Learning, which is a Data Science technique commonly used. 
* [Part 3](part-3-active-learning.md) provides an example of Active Learning, which is a more sophisticated Data Science technique.
