# Logical Inference and AI Planning with GOAP

[Goal-Oriented Action Planning \(GOAP\)](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html) is a simple, but popular AI planner that uses logical chaining to achieve goals by performing a sequence of actions that change the world state \(from preconditions to postconditions\).  States are generally boolean conditions and actions can have associated costs and the planner will find the cheapest sequence.

For this exercise, we are going to use the [Maana Q AI Simulator framework](../../../product-guide/reference-guide/ai-simulator-framework/).  Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with its purpose and operation.
