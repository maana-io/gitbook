# Logical Inference and AI Planning with GOAP

Goal-Oriented Action Planning \(GOAP\) is a simple, but popular AI planner that uses logical chaining to achieve goals by performing a sequence of actions that change the world state.  States are boolean conditions.  Actions can have associated costs and the planner will find the cheapest path.

[Jeff Orkin's website](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html), the inventor of GOAP, is a good place to find more information on the subject, including articles, videos, and source code.
