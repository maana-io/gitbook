# Logical Inference and Semantic Graphs

A semantic graph is a graph \(node and edges\) whose nodes represent **entities** and **values** and whose edges represent **predicates**  and **relationships**.  Inference in a semantic graph essentially involves discovering new relationships.

For example, if we say that Bob is the child of Mary and Mary is the child of Sonja, then, with just this information, we can infer that Bob is the grandchild of Sonja.  And these relationships can be expressed in the opposite direction: parent instead of child, grandparent instead of grandchild.

So, inference is fundamentally about saying as little and then deriving as much as possible through various _rules_.
