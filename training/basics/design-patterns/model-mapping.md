# Model Mapping

## Problem

Your custom domain, e.g., an [autonomous-driving taxi planner](../../../product-guide/reference-guide/ai-simulator-framework/simulators/openai-gym/taxi-v3-environment.md), would benefit from a generic reasoner \(service\), e.g., [GOAP AI Planner](https://maana.gitbook.io/q/v/3.2.1/training/advanced/inference/logical-inference-and-ai-planning#maana-ai-goap). 

How do you go from your domain to that of the of the generic service?
