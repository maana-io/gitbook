# Specialization and Enrichment

## Problem

Start with a basic concept \(Kind\) and create additional Kinds that refine it, e.g., Part, RotatingPart, HydraulicPart, ElectricalPart, RotatingElectricalPart, ...

The base concept, e.g., Part, contains all the common properties/relations for parts in general

The specialized \(or enriched\) concepts, e.g., RotatingPart, encompasses the base concept \(Part\), but extends it in some way, e.g., maxRotationalVelocity, which doesn't apply to all part in general, only a **subset** of them

## Solution
