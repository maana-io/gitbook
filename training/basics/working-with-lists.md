**Case Description:**

Let's make sure only those people who are over 21 are allowed into MaanaQ Bar. This example lets us do just that. In the process, learn how to work with lists. While developing solutions, many times we have to perform a certain operation on multiple items. To simplify the process of parallel computing, Maana Q allows you to execute functions on multiple items while efficiently caching the result. Maana Q runs the function in parallel using all the available computation resource. We have a list of people and their birthdays. Let's find out who can enter!
