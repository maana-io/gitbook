# Function Composition

We've already seen several basic examples of function composition.  In this session, you will be challenged to devise the solutions to one of two problems:

* Given a topic, what are the entities \(people, places, organizations\) from NY Times headlines?
  * Difficulty: `EASY`
* Given a YouTube video and a target language, what is the translated transcript?
  * Difficulty: `MEDIUM`

Either individually or in groups, your mission is to tackle one of the above problems.  At the end, you will be asked to share your results.

## Lesson Goals

* Work through several more sophisticated examples of function composition
* Use the Maana Scalar service
* Use several third-party services and libraries
