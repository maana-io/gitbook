# Function Composition

We've already seen several basic examples of function composition.  In this session, you will be challenged to devise the solutions to one of two problems:

* Given a topic, what are the entities \(people, places, organizations\) from NY Times headlines
* Given a YouTube video and a target language, what is the translated transcript?

## Overview

This lesson is more of a challenge session.  The intent is either individually or in groups to tackle one of the above problems.  At the end, you will be asked to share your results.

## Lesson Goals

* Work through several more sophisticated examples of function composition
* Use the Maana Scalar service
* Use several third-party services and libraries
