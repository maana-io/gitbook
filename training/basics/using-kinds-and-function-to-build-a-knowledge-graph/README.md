# Introduction to Kinds and Functions

## [Kinds](https://app.gitbook.com/@maana/s/q/v/3.2.1/product-guide/reference-guide/technical-design-and-architecture/kinds-and-fields/~/settings/share)

**Kinds** represent a specific interpretation of a concept which have a collection of fields used to describe their attributes. Ex: a kind called ‘City’ may consist of name, latitude, longitude

## [Functions](https://app.gitbook.com/@maana/s/q/~/drafts/-LvBRj60Zf4rtd8JrBE7/v/3.2.1/product-guide/reference-guide/technical-design-and-architecture/function-modeling/create-a-new-function/~/settings/share)

**Functions**  are used to represent problem-questions in Q. Consider, "Given x, what is y?" Functions allow you to define x and y and break the problem down further \(decompose it\) into smaller pieces. The Q UI allows connecting Functions together in meaningful ways to form the computational portion of your solutions. Functions are representations of GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Managed Kinds

Managed Kinds are the user defined Kinds that KindDB provides persistence for. They are called "Managed" Kinds because they are by default, “managed” by Maana Q database i.e. they are allocated storage and receive CRUD boilerplate. Alternatively, a user can define an entire service in the workspace that has nothing to do with KindDB, one can choose to “override” Maana Q's persistence for certain Kinds and let Q handle the rest.
