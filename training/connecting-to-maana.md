&lt;&gt;



It will then give you this window:

![](https://maanaimages.blob.core.windows.net/maana-q-documentation/Accessing%20the%20Portal/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-06%20at%205.50.43%20PM.png)

This is setting up 2FA **“2nd Factor Authentication”**.

Go ahead and open **“Google Authenticator”** on your phone _\(download if you don't have it\)_ and scan the bar code. It will save an entry in the app under _“maana-sales”_ which will give you a 6-digit code that auto renews every 30 seconds.

**OR**

You can select **“SMS”** instead. Key in your phone number and it should text you a 6-digit code.

**You will use this code every time you login to** [**cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io**](http://cstrainingstable.knowledge.maana.io) **If you chose Google Authenticator, open the app to get the code each time you login. If you chose SMS, it will text you a code instead.**

\*\*\*\*

&lt;&gt;



Then, another window will appear:

![](https://maanaimages.blob.core.windows.net/maana-q-documentation/Accessing%20the%20Portal/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-06%20at%206.02.15%20PM.png)

Please save this code somewhere safe where you are the only one who can see it. This is for the event that you have to login without your device \(Google Authenticator, SMS\)

Check the box, then click Continue and it should take you to the portal.
