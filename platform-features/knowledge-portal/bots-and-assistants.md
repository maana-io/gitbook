# Bots and Assistants

Bots help developers automate many of the tasks of building machine learning models and perform automatic event-driven actions or notify other bots or users to take certain actions. Examples of bots that come with the Platform are:

* Form knowledge and create the graph
* Capture expertise
* Integrate data into graph
* Extract and add knowledge 
* Derive value from knowledge
* Automate building machine learning models
* Extract complex knowledge from data 
* Reason over knowledge

In addition to bots and assistants that come with the Platform, developers can develop additional bots and assistants and make them part of their Maana platform deployment.
