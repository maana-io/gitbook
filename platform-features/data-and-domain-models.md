# Data and Domain Models

Create models that represent both your business domains and data, whatever its source.

* Data from any source and in any format can be seamlessly integrated, modeled and leveraged as a part of the Knowledge Layer
* Subject-matter experts can leverage the Knowledge Portal to encode their expertise in the form of domain models
* This forms the digitized, reusable tacit knowledge that is often the competitive edge for businesses
* Domain modeling is not a one time task and models are able to be easily edited to account for the fast paced, ever changing nature of the modern enterprise
