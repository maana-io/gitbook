# Bot Control Panel

The Bot Control Panel is there to give you a status update of what each bot is doing. So, for example, if there is a bot running in the background the control panel will display its name or ID, the status, the available actions that can be taken, and an estimated time to finish.  

### From the Bot control panel you are able to:

* Start/stop of individual Bots for a Kind.
* Navigation to the Assistant for the Bot.
* Interact/Invoke the Field Classifier Assistant
