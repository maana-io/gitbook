# Complex Function Composition

\[TBD\] @Bryan

**TODO**: Use the information in this image to build a basic introduction to complex function composition.

## Function flows can be split and merged

For example: Get the distance between the depot \(location\) and the closest well. Then, get the closest well, and then get the distance from the depot of that well.

## Making a more complicated function implementation

**TODO**: Build a function implementation \(Complex Flow: Serial should be a good starting point\)

## Breaking a function out into multiple sub functions

**TODO**: We want to make them step by step process of breaking a complex function into multiple parts

### Locate the different parts that should be moved out

**TODO**: Take the user through finding the different parts that can be broken out

### Breaking the functions out

**TODO**: Actually break the function into pieces
