# GraphQL

### GraphQL DataQuery Language

Maana uses GraphQL to represent and expose its Computational Knowledge Graph. GraphQL is a data query language created by Facebook and open-sourced in 2015 as an alternative to REST interfaces.

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in the API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. With the GraphQL-type system, developers can access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint.

GraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. The developer provides functions for each field in the type system, and GraphQL calls them with optimal concurrency.

### GraphQL Features

GraphQl query language is maintainable, with the ability to evolve an application program interface \(API\) without multiple versioning.   With GraphQL, old Clients remain unaffected by new features and deprecating fields discourage new uses.  It is an open specification language offering a lean core, multiple implementations and encourages ongoing innovation.  Utilizing GraphQL:

* The server is decoupled from the Client.
* The server knows almost nothing about Clients.
* Apps request exactly the data they need.
* It is mush easier to pull data into the Client models.

#### GraphQL models data in an intuitive way:

* Nodes have Attributes.
* Nodes have links to other Nodes.
* It suits our model of the world.
* Meshes well with object-oriented programming.

#### GraphQL is editable:

* It is capable of fetching everything need with only one request.
* It fetches only the data that is needed.
* It has the ability to specify data requirements locally.

GraphQL is strongly typed and introspective, featuring documentation that is built-in, powerful tooling, and the ability to can catch errors easily.  

#### GraphQL acts as a single source of truth:

* It supports multiple back ends.
* It can pull data from anything.
* It is resilient.
* It uses existing application logic.
* It is _not_ a storage engine.

### GraphQL Schema Language - Type System

#### Object Type

Represents a node within the GraphQL graph:

`type Human {  
    name:  String  
    currentlocation:  String`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  Must have _at least_ one **field**.
{% endhint %}

#### Object Type:  Field Resolvers

**Resolvers** are passed with 3 main Arguments:

1. **Object** - The Object on which the Field is being resolved.
2. **Args** - The Arguments passed to the Field.
3. **Context** - A Context object useful for authentication and caching.

#### Object Type:  Summary

This represents a **Node** within the GraphQL graph:

`type Human {  
    name:  String  
    currentlocation:  (approximate: Boolean): String  
favouritePosts(first: Int = 5 after: Cursor): [Post}  
}`

For each Node:

* They must have at least one **Field**.
  * Each Field must return a defined **Type**.
  * Fields are backed by a function called a **Resolver**.
  * Fields can have **Arguments**.
    * Arguments can have **Defaults**.

#### Union Types

Union Types are assumed to have _no Fields in common_.

`{  
  search(terms:  "Star Wars")  {  
       ... on Film  {  
          title  
          duration  
      }  
      ... on Publisher  {  
          name  
          address  
       }  
     }  
    }`   

### GraphQL Schema Language - Writing a Schema

#### The Mutation Type

A typical example might look like this:

`type mutation  {  
    setGreeting(input:  SetGreetingInput):  SetGreetingPayLoad  
}  
input  SetGreetingInput  {  
   newGreeting:  String  
}  
type  SetGreetingPayLoad  {  
   greeting:  String`

#### Schema Example

`scalar  JSON  
enum Color  {  RED,  GREEN,  BLUE,  OCTARINE  }  
input AgeRange  {  min:  Float!,  max:  Float!  }  
interface NamedEntity  {  name:  String!  }  
  
"""Someone who can log in"""  
type User implements NamedEntity  {  
   firstName:  String @deprecated(reason:  "Please use 'name' instead")  
   name:  String!  
   #  To the nearest nanaosecond  
   age:  Float  
   meta:  JSON  
   favoriteColor:  Color  
   friends:  [User}  
}  
type Query  {  
   viewer:  User  
   usersByAge(range:  AgeRange):  [User!]  
}`

####  Anatomy of a GraphQL Query

This is an example of a simple GraphQL query; 

`{  
   currentUser  {  
   name  
   website  
  }  
}`

`query ProfileQuery {  
    currentUser  {  
         name  
         website  
      }  
 }`

The name \(`ProfileQuery`\) is an optional, arbitrary name for the query.  It is useful for debugging.

#### Directives

Directives can be used to change how the server processes the query.  The GraphQL specification defines two directives:

1. @include
2. @skip

`query ProfileQuery(  
  $id: Int!,  
  $toggle: Boolean = true  
) {                                                              {  
     user(id:  $id)  {                                              "user": {  
        name          @include(if: $toggle)                          "name": "Bob Smith"  
        website        @skip(if: $toggle)                          }  
     }                                                              }  
  }`

#### Recap:

`query  ProfileQuery($id:  Int!)  {  
  user(id: $id) {  
     fullname: name  
     website  
  }  
}  
query                                #Operation type  
ProfileQuery                         #Operation name, for debugging  
($id:  Int!)                         #Variables and their types  
{                                    #Selection set  
     user(id:  $id)                  #Field with arguments, variable reference  
     {                               #Nested selection set  
          fullName:  name            #Aliased field, fetches 'name', calls it 'fullName'  
          website                    #Field sans alias  
     }                
}`               

### GraphQL Fragments

#### The Anatomy of a Fragment

`fragment GreetUserFragment on User {  
  id  
  name                    query MyQuery {  
}                           currentUser {      
                               id  
query MyQuery {                id  
currentUser {                  name  
  id                          }  
  ...GreetUserFragment      }  
     }  
}`     

#### Fragments can Compose other Fragments:

`quey MyQuery {  
  currentUser {  
     ...UserProfileFragment  
  }  
}  
fragment UserProfileFragment on User {  
  id  
  name  
  bio  
  ...LargeUserAvatarFragment  
}  
fragment LargeUserAvatarFragment on User {  
   largeAvatar: avatar(size: 300, retina: true)  
}`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  Simple string concatenation, as shown here, will not allow the same fragment twice.  It is suggested that a tool such as Apollo or Relay be used to do this.
{% endhint %}

#### **Inline Fragments**

A variant of these named fragments are anonymous inline fragments.

`{  
   search(phrase: "cream"){  
     ...on Food{  
       manufacturer  
       calories  
    }  
    ...on BeautyProduct {  
      manufacturer  
      spf  
    }  
    ...on Paint {  
      manufacturer  
      hexColor  
     }  
    }  
  }`

### Graph Mutations

#### Multiple Mutations in One Query

The following illustrates how to perform multiple mutations in one query:

`mutation {  
  # Mutation 1  
  updateCurrentUser(input: {  
    userPatch: {  
      website: "https://twitter.com/benjie"  
    }  
  }) {  
     user { website }  
  }   
  #Mutation 2  
  setGreeting(input: {  
    newGreeting: "Hello Universe!"  
  }) {  
     greeting  
  }  
}`



#### Object Type

Represents a node within the GraphQL graph:

`type Human {  
    name:  String  
    currentlocation:  String`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  Must have _at least_ one **field**.
{% endhint %}

#### Object Type:  Field Resolvers

**Resolvers** are passed with 3 main Arguments:

1. **Object** - The Object on which the Field is being resolved.
2. **Args** - The Arguments passed to the Field.
3. **Context** - A Context object useful for authentication and caching.

#### Object Type:  Summary

This represents a **Node** within the GraphQL graph:

`type Human {  
    name:  String  
    currentlocation:  (approximate: Boolean): String  
favouritePosts(first: Int = 5 after: Cursor): [Post}  
}`  


For each Node:

* They must have at least one **Field**.
  * Each Field must return a defined **Type**.
  * Fields are backed by a function called a **Resolver**.
  * Fields can have **Arguments**.
    * Arguments can have **Defaults**.

#### Union Types

Union Types are assumed to have _no Fields in common_.

`{  
  search(terms:  "Star Wars")  {  
       ... on Film  {  
          title  
          duration  
      }  
      ... on Publisher  {  
          name  
          address  
       }  
     }  
    }`
