# What You Will Learn

## The "ORDL" framework for problem solving

1. **Observe** the problem domain.
2. **Reason** over the problem domain to make \(explicable\) recommendations.
3. **Decide** \(help a user\) what action to take.
4. **Learn** from the outcome of the decision in order to make better recommendations.
5. Repeat from step 1

Formally known as the ORDL loop, the above sequence of process steps provides a general framework for problem solving and subsequent solution development. 

## Problem-Question \(PQ\) Decomposition

Problem-Question decomposition is a Maana recommended methodology that allows you to move from a general business objective to very clear, digitized and shareable user requirements.

The idea is to work recursively through a problem decomposition process in order to define and scope a specific problem domain. See figure below. This also helps scope the broader task of creating the overall knowledge layer for an organization or the enterprise.

By working recursively through the problem-question decomposition process, you will derive a high-level solution architecture from your business objective. With the proper framework defined, you can now move on to the implementation of this architecture in the Maana platform.

## After reading this User Education documentation, you will be

* Familiar with the [GraphQL concepts](../reference-guide/graphql/) underlying Maana’s platform;
* Able to implement the [solutions development process](../getting-started-with-maana/building-knowledge-layers/) as intended for your role;
* Able to use both UI and Programmatic methods of engaging with the Platform features;
* Able to [create Knowledge Microservices](../getting-started-with-maana/building-knowledge-layers/about-knowledge-microservices.md) that interact with and enhance your solution’s Knowledge Graph;
* Able to [create Knowledge Applications](../getting-started-with-maana/creating-knowledge-applications.md) that provide a well defined, dedicated visual interface into your solution’s Knowledge Graph
