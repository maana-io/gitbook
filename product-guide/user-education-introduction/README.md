# Introduction

### Overview

The purpose of Maana's User Education \(UE\) experience for Q Platform is to provide: a perspective on how to use the latest version of the Maana Q Platform, and to engage with our user base to reflect all current best practices containing the information you need, when and where you will need it . 

Whether you're already a Maana customer or you're a potential customer who wants to learn the platform, this site will serve as your primary resource for Maana Q's: 

* Product Guide
* Role Guides \(Analyst, Architect, Developer, Data Scientist, Tester, & Administrator\)
* Cookbook of practical exercises/tutorials
* Reference Section of additional recommended resources

Each of these artifacts will be updated for all subsequent Maana releases, giving you a single source of truth to return to for current information about the Maana Platform.

### What is Knowledge?

In our view, knowledge can be thought of as an answer to a question. Let's pretend for a moment that you are enrolled in a course at a college of your choosing. If you pass the final exam, or get a passing grade for that course, the implication is that you now have sufficient knowledge about the course's topic. You've demonstrated that you're able to answer to intermediate/advanced questions on the topic, that's why you're considered to be knowledgeable.

In the same way, as a user of Maana, you can think of knowledge abstractly as the ability to answer questions. What you are building on Maana is a knowledge layer, knowledge solutions, and/or knowledge microservices. You are _not_ ****creating a relational database, you _are_ creating the basis upon which the Maana platform will become knowledgeable about your business's problems and complexities. You're building an understanding of real-life _things_, their _properties_, and the complex and dynamic _relationships_ between those things in such a way that the knowledge layer created can be used to ~~answer~~ more and more difficult questions about your business.

### What makes Maana Q unique?

Traditionally, a lot of the the know-how that is in the heads of an organization's employees stays in those employees' heads. Maana is unique because it allows those people to encode their knowledge onto a platform, and then re-purpose and re-express that knowledge in all sorts of new and interesting ways.

How is this done? Let's use the process of writing code as an example. When you write code, you are putting some knowledge in a place where only a few people can get to it, and even fellow developers are going to have a hard time fully understanding what's going on in your code. They have to take the time to read it through and build a mental model of it - so they could understand what may be hidden or missing. They would likely have to ask clarifying questions in order to arrive at a desired level of understanding.

Maana is unique because it makes transparent the inner workings of the knowledge that's been encoded into it. That allows us to  re-use that knowledge _at scale_ across any number of other solutions and microservices. 

To illustrate this point, consider that Maana Knowledge Solutions have been used to answer questions like:

1. Given a set of invoices, what is the optimal collection plan?
2. Given a set of malware victims, who are the most vulnerable likely victims?
3. Given a patient history and a patient condition, what is the most relevant history?
4. Given a set of Bitcoin wallets, what are the most likely fraudulent transactions?
5. Given a customer equipment failure, what is the recommended repair action?
6. Given a set of insurance claims, which are most likely fraudulent?
7. Given a job activity, what are the relevant Health & Safety considerations?
