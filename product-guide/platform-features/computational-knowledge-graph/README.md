# Computational Knowledge Graph \(CKG\)

The core of the Maana Knowledge Platform™ is the patented Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™.

* It is not a graph database, nor relies on ontologies and description logics
* The Computational Knowledge Graph separates the structure and computations to be performed from the data itself
* It enables a fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source or format to be seamlessly integrated, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed
* Each resulting model is a combination of subject-matter expertise, relevant data, and the algorithms to be performed
* The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph is dynamic because it can represent conceptual and computational models
* It is designed to perform complex transformations and calculations at interactive speeds, making it a game-changing technology for agile development knowledge applications
