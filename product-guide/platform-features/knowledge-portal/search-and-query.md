# Search and Query

The Search capability is foundational to the application development on the Platform for the developers of knowledge applications.

* They can search for everything on the computational knowledge graph
* They extend from basic building blocks such as Functions and Kinds \(and their instances\) to higher order components such as Knowledge/Function Graphs and Services
* The results are disambiguated into six major buckets that make it easy for the developer to find exactly what they are looking for
* Once the right components are found they are dragged into the Knowledge Portal to select, connect, curate, and populate the graph of kinds and services that form their Workspace
