# RC2-012: Unable to save workspace as a service

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
An error is thrown when adding a service through the Admin Panel using the URL of a Workspace saved as a service. The service requires authentication which is not supported by the platform presently. As this is a service that was added manually, the platform treats it as external service and cannot optimize to bypass authentication.

`Workaround: In GraphQL, use the addService mutation on maana-portal (or maana-catalog) by including isManaged: true in the request.`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Repro Steps" %}
1. Create a Workspace
2. Open the info panel of Workspace and copy "Workspace Service URL" field
3. Open Admin Panel
4. Create a service based on the copied service URL
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Expected Results" %}
The service is successfully created.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Actual Results" %}
Error is thrown as follows:

```text
Failed to save the service: GraphQL error:

[{"message":"Response not successful:
