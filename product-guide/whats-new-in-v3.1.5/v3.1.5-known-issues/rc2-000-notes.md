# RC2-000-Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
Maana only supports GraphQL scalar types.

Graphene JSONString is not a graphql scalar type as defined by spec \(or defacto standard support\). JSON types as scalars are only supported if they are defined as "JSON".

Removing a kind from your workspace doesn't delete it, meaning that it still exists, and all boilerplate should be available for it.
